        <h1>About Stephen King</h1>
       <p>Stephen King was born in Portland, Maine in 1947, the second son of Donald and Nellie Ruth Pillsbury King. He made his first professional short story sale in 1967 to 
        Startling Mystery Stories. In the fall of 1971, he began teaching high school English classes at Hampden Academy, the public high school in Hampden, Maine. Writing in the 
        evenings and on the weekends, he continued to produce short stories and to work on novels. In the spring of 1973, Doubleday & Co., accepted the novel Carrie for 
        publication, providing him the means to leave teaching and write full-time. He has since published over 50 books and has become one of the world's most successful 
        writers. King is the recipient of the 2003 National Book Foundation Medal for Distinguished Contribution to the American Letters and the 2014 National Medal of Arts. 
        Stephen lives in Maine and Florida with his wife, novelist Tabitha King. They are regular contributors to a number of charities including many libraries and have 
        been honored locally for their philanthropic activities.</p>

                <h1>Favorite Books</h1>
                <p>My favorite hobby is reading, and Stephen King is definitely my favorite author. It was difficult to narrow it down to just three, but these are my favorite books by him. I've read almost everything he's ever written (about six books shy currently), and I've read my favorites at least half a dozen times. 
                    He has written over sixty books, and none of them are the same. He has an incredible imagination! My favorite thing about him is how he has created this whole universe,
                    and there are many parallels between his novels. He always references events from his other novels, and the same characters often play a role in more than one book.</p>

                    <h4><i>The Stand</i></h4>
                    <p>This is my most read book by SK. The first time I read it I was 17, and I literally could not put it down. It's probably his longest book at around 1300 pages.
                    It's a post-apocalyptic book about the remaining survivors after the military accidentally releases a mutating strain of the flu that wipes out 99.9% of the population.
                    When COVID first started happening, I thought a lot about this book... you can probably imagine why.</p>

                    <h4><i>Salem's Lot</i></h4>
                    <p><i>Salem's Lot</i> is about a novelist who returns to his hometown only to discover that it's being slowly taken over by vampires.
                    One of the characters is a Catholic priest who, despite being a good man, is an alcoholic and suffering from a deep crisis of faith. Father Callahan is defeated
                    and damned in Salem's Lot but makes a reappearance in one of the novels in the <i>Dark Tower</i> series. Roland Deschain finds him in Calla Bryn Sturgis, and it's there 
                    that Father Callahan ultimately finds redemption.</p>

                    <h4><i>Doctor Sleep</i></h4>
                    <p><i>Doctor Sleep</i> is the sequel to <i>The Shining</i>, one of King's most famous books. While I enjoyed the first book, I definitely enjoyed the second one way more. It's told
                    from the point of view of Danny (the redrum kid) who has grown up to be a very disturbed and tormented person. He's an alcoholic, a drug addict, and basically homeless. He hits rock bottom
                    at the beginning of the book and spends the rest of it clawing his way back up. He finds his will to live after meeting a little girl named Abba who initially reaches out to him as a toddler
                    using telepathy. A group of "soul vampires" are searching for her, and it's up to him to protect her.</p>
